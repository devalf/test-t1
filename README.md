## Testing task

In the project directory execute:

### `npm i && npm start`

It runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in the browser to load Application.

Since it is testing task with limited time for development, here was implemented the base logic without any advanced features such as `Modular CSS` and many more advanced tools and approaches 

So available features:
* advanced searching through the multiple users fields
* multiple conditions searching such as - A and B, A or B (very base DEMO approach)
* changing user status and reflect common statistic
